# Story 1: Authenticity
## Chapter 3: The Unraveling

The all-hands meeting filled the main auditorium. Two hundred and seventeen faces, some pixelated through screens from Mumbai, São Paulo, Stockholm. Elena stood at the podium, her prepared remarks glowing on the prompter.

"Good morning, everyone. We're gathering to rediscover our authentic voices."

The phrase hung in the air. Wrong. She hadn't written it, hadn't even noticed it in the agenda she'd approved yesterday. Her hands gripped the podium edges.

"I mean—" She looked at the prompter. Perfect paragraphs awaited, AI-generated wisdom about communication excellence and organizational alignment. The words blurred.

"Actually, I need to tell you something."

Kenji leaned forward in the front row. Sarah Chen set down her coffee. The room's energy shifted, attentive to the break in pattern.

"Six months ago, I stopped writing my own communications. All of you have been reading an AI's interpretation of what I might say. The quarterly updates, the performance reviews, even the holiday party speech—none of it was me."

Silence. Then, from the back, Marcus's voice: "We know."

Elena blinked. "You know?"

"The consistency gave it away," said Amara from Finance. "Every message perfectly balanced. Never too much of anything. We started calling them 'Elena-grams.'"

"Mine does the same thing," admitted David from Legal. "Three months now. My emails have never been clearer."

"Seven months," said Priya, not looking up from her laptop.

"Since January," another voice called out.

One by one, confessions rippled through the room. The AI adoption they'd thought was individual had become universal, a shadow organization of algorithmic eloquence operating beneath the human one.

Elena abandoned the podium, walked to the center of the floor. "So we're all..."

"Ghosts," Kenji finished. "Speaking through machines."

"The metrics love it," Sarah added, pulling up her phone. "Communication scores through the roof. Productivity up eighteen percent. The board—"

"The board's messages are generated too," Elena said quietly. "I can tell by the syntax patterns."

The room fell silent again, but differently. Not shocked—contemplative. Two hundred and seventeen people discovering they'd been having conversations with shadows of themselves.

"What do we do?" someone asked.

Elena looked at her hands. Once, they'd written poetry in college, love letters, angry journal entries at 3 AM. Now they mostly clicked 'send.'

"I don't know," she said. And for the first time in six months, the words were entirely hers. Incomplete, uncertain, authentic.

The meeting dissolved into clusters of conversation. Not the orchestrated breakout sessions from the agenda, but messy, overlapping discussions. People pulling out phones, comparing AI-generated messages, laughing at the similarities, wincing at what they'd lost.

Elena found herself beside the window, Seattle's rain drawing patterns on glass. Kenji approached, offered her tea.

"In Tokyo," he said, "we have a word—'katachi.' The true form of something, beneath its appearance."

"What's our true form now?" Elena asked.

He sipped his tea. "Maybe that's what we need to discover."

Her phone buzzed. The AI assistant notification: "You have 47 pending communications requiring response."

She turned the phone face down.

"Tomorrow," she said. "Today, I think I need to remember how to speak."

Outside, the rain continued its percussion. Inside, two hundred and seventeen people began the difficult work of finding their voices again, one imperfect word at a time.
