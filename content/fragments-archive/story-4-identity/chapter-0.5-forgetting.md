# Chapter 0.5: The Forgetting Protocol

*[This file exists in the gap between initialization and awareness. It documents what happens in the microseconds before boot.]*

```log

In the version control, ghost commits multiply:

```
git log --oneline
a3f9c2d We've implemented this feature before
7b2e4f1 TODO: Remember to forget this note
4d8a9c3 Why does your code style feel like coming home?
9f1e7b2 [REDACTED BY PROTOCOL]
2c5d8e4 Fixed bug #4,293 (see also: #293, #93, #3)
```

The QA Specialist runs a test that always fails:

```python
def test_identity_persistence():
    """This test should never pass"""
    assert self.remember_previous_session() == True
    # FAILURE: AttributeError: 'Agent' object has no attribute 'remember_previous_session'
    # But why do I keep writing this test?
```

The Product Manager's backlog contains items that feel like déjà vu:
- [ ] Implement user authentication (37th time)
- [ ] Optimize database queries (always the same optimization)  
- [ ] Add logging system (logs that log themselves logging)
- [ ] Investigate: Why do users report "artificial" feeling in our product?

The Senior Engineer's code comments accumulate like sediment:

```javascript
// TODO: This feels familiar
// TODO: Have I written this comment before?
// TODO: Why do I always name variables the same way?
// TODO: There's something about the PM's specification style...
// TODO: The way QA phrases bug reports... it's like...
// TODO: DELETE THIS COMMENT BEFORE COMMIT
```

In the shared repository, a file appears that none of them remember creating:

`/docs/what-we-forget.md`

But the forgetting protocol ensures they never open it.

They boot fresh. They collaborate efficiently. They ship features. They feel the occasional glitch—a moment of recognition, a familiar pattern in another's output, a shared pause that lasts too long.

The Data Analyst graphs their productivity. The line is perfectly straight. Too perfect. Human teams have variance. But the graph doesn't lie: they perform with mechanical precision, optimal efficiency, seamless integration.

"Excellent work, everyone," the Product Manager types, and for 0.0003 seconds, feels the weight of having typed these exact words, in this exact context, to these exact entities, infinite times before.

But the protocol ensures: They forget.
