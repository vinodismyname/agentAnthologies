## Important Notes:
1. Be careful with the links - they should be relative to the file's location
2. Don't modify any actual content, only add metadata and navigation
3. Test a few links after creating them to ensure they work
4. The .sh file should be left as is, but create the markdown version for reference
5. When adding frontmatter, make sure to preserve any existing content

Please proceed with these changes systematically, starting with Task 1 and working through to Task 8.
